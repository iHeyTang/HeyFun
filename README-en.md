# ðŸŽ‰ HeyFun

Hey! Let's bring a little fun to this world together.

## Project Vision

1. A versatile AI assistant for general domains, providing the strongest support for super individuals and one-person companies in the AI era
2. Rapid development and validation of specialized domain AI agents, offering the best efficiency platform for vertical AI Agents

## Project Demo

1. Network search and automatic note-taking in Flomo through MCP
   https://www.heyfun.ai/share/tasks/cm9k3hmiv00ezo8011k4008qx

2. Text-to-image generation using MiniMax through MCP, further converting the generated images into video
   https://www.heyfun.ai/share/tasks/cmbnaws9y001xqr01e7miwpme

## Installation Guide

The project is divided into two parts: Core (root directory) and App (web/)

### HeyFun Agent

1. Install uv (a fast Python package manager):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iHeyTang/HeyFun.git
cd HeyFun
```

3. Create and activate virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS systems
# For Windows systems use:
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# After successful installation, you'll see the following prompt. You can either restart Terminal or follow these instructions:
#To add $HOME/.local/bin to your PATH, either restart your shell or run:
#    source $HOME/.local/bin/env (sh, bash, zsh)
#    source $HOME/.local/bin/env.fish (fish)

# Verify uv installation success
uv --version
# Output the following version number indicates successful installation
# uv 0.6.14 (a4cec56dc 2025-04-09)
```

4. Install dependencies:

````bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

### Install browser automation tool playwright
```bash
playwright install
````

5. Install Docker environment, recommended [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows, [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/download) for MacOS or Linux

### HeyFun Web

1. Install `node` environment

   Method 1: [Recommended] Use nvm package manager https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
   Method 2: Download from official website https://nodejs.org/en
   Method 3: (Windows systems) Use nvm package manager https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.2.2

```bash
# After installation, verify success with command
node -v
# Output version number indicates successful installation
# v20.19.0
```

2. Enter `web/` folder

```bash
# Ignore if already in web directory
cd web
```

3. Install project dependencies

```bash
# Install project dependencies
npm install
```

4. Generate key pair

The project requires a public-private key pair for authentication, which can be generated with the following command (skip if you can generate certificates yourself):

```bash
npm run generate-keys

# This will generate in the `web/keys` directory:
# - `private.pem`: Private key file
# - `public.pem`: Public key file
```

5. Database initialization

The project uses PostgreSQL as the persistent database. You can use [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) to start the database service

```bash
# Start docker container and automatically create database named heyfun
docker run --name heyfun-db -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=heyfun -d -p 5432:5432 postgres
```

6. Environment variable configuration

Create `.env` file in project root directory, configure necessary environment variables, refer to `/web/.env.example`

```bash
# If following step 5 database configuration, the database connection is
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/heyfun?schema=public"
```

7. Generate Prisma Client & Initialize Database

```bash
# If first time starting project, reinstalled dependencies, or schema.prisma has updates, execute this command to update Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# If first time starting project, need to initialize database, this command will automatically sync table structure into configured database
npx prisma db push
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# HeyFun Agent starts with run_api.py
python run_api.py
```

```bash
# HeyFun Web needs to enter web/ directory, start with npm run dev
cd web
npm run dev
```

After starting, open `http://localhost:3000` to view

## MCP Tool Configuration

When self-deploying, the Tools Market does not have initialized data. Since the interactive page for adding tools to the marketplace is not fully implemented yet, there are two ways to introduce MCP tools:

1. You can use Custom Tool to manually configure MCP tools in the input configuration dialog.
2. You can refer to `scripts/init_tool_schemas.sql` to directly insert the corresponding data into the database.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the [OpenManus](https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus) First Hackathon. Within OpenManus's geek community, I not only gained access to cutting-edge technical discussions but also experienced invaluable growth through open-source collaboration and innovation. It was OpenManus's open platform and technical support that enabled HeyFun to evolve from concept to reality. Here, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to OpenManus and its community for their inspiration and assistance. May we continue to push the boundaries of AI technology together through geek exploration and infinite possibilities!
